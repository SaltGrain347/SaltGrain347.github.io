        <h1>Forgotten by Salt</h1>
            Hello this is a page where there bunch of old and unused content now no longer used and scrapped stuff that didn't make it or just never finished.<br>
            <small>(this entire thing was based on <a href="https://tptf.neocities.org/unused">ThatPizzaTowerFan's Unused, Old & Scrapped Gallery</a>)</small><br><br>
            <h2>"Gillery.png"</h2>
            <img src="Gillery.png"><br>
            Unfinished picture that was supposed to be used for <a href="/Fandom">Fandom Page</a>, earlier idea was an Deltarune Elevator where the button are the Fandom Icon, that was scrapped for many reason.
            <h2>Delisted Project Thumbnail</h2>
            <div class="ProjectImage">
                <img src="/Project/Thumbnail/DoorMissing.png">
                <img src="/Project/Thumbnail/ThisIsAxol.png">
            </div>
            Basically bunch of thumbnail that were used then removed because I didn't felt proud of their projects.
            <h2>DiscCase.png</h2>
            <img src="DiscCase.png"><br>
            Supposed to be used on <a href="/Project/index">Featured Project</a> but didn't know how to move the disc properly and doesn't look good.
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="/main"><img src="/Button/Return.png" class="SaltButton"
